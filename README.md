Grafana 2 - KairosDB Datasource Plugin
======================================

This is a plugin that allows Grafana 2 to support KairosDB as datasource.

**IMPORTANT:** half of the source code came from the plugin grafana-kairosdb-datasource-plugin for Grafana 1.9 ( https://github.com/Kratos-ISE/grafana-kairosdb-datasource-plugin ) and I adapted it to Grafana 2.

Installation:
=============

Copy the plugin folder **kairosdb** inside the folder for plugins in Grafana 2. In Debian Linux this path is located at /opt/grafana/current/public/app/plugins/datasource/

TODO
====

* Almost no testing has been done yet, except for metrics support.
* Missing support for Annotations
